# Heart Disease Prediction Project
**This repository contains the code and analysis for a project on predicting heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease dataset.**

## Project Overview
**This project investigates the factors that contribute to heart disease and builds a machine learning model to predict its presence in patients.**

### Tasks:

***Data analysis***: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the dataset and identify potential relationships between features and heart disease.

***Machine learning***: Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict heart disease based on various features.

### Data

The project utilizes the UCI Heart Disease dataset: [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)

### Methodology

*Data Preprocessing*:

Load the dataset.

Explore data distribution and perform necessary transformations.

Feature engineering.

*Exploratory Data Analysis*:

Analyze the distribution of features for both patients with and without heart disease.

Identify potential correlations between features and heart disease.

Visualize insights using appropriate plots and charts.

*Machine Learning Model Development*:

Train and evaluate various machine learning models for predicting heart disease.

Compare and select the best performing model based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

*Results and Discussion*:

Summarize key findings from data analysis and model performance.

Discuss the effectiveness of the chosen machine learning model for heart disease prediction.

Identify limitations and potential future work directions.
